EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL, MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Tom Clancy espionage music comes up; lots of snare drums and
strings...

The muted clicking of computer keys accompanies the title:

NEW YORK CITY -- .JACOBIM MUGATU FALL UNDERPANTS LINE
UNVEILING PARTY

CUT TO:
INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL-- PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

The party is in full swing. A POSTER of ANTONIO SABATO OR.,
modeling MUGATU underpants is the centerpiece of the room.
Almost surreally, the real SABATO, wearing only underwear,
dances into frame humping the air to an impossibly fast
PRODIGY number as a CROWD cheers him on.

ANGLE ON:
AMBER VALETTA and CARLA BRUNI

AMBER
The guy on Canal Street gets out way more
than the guy on 23rd.

CARLA
That’s what I’m hearing.

AMBER
it’s true. I mean, I looked at this big
bag of sludge and just couldn’t believe
that all that was in me.

CARLA
I know.

ANGLE ON:

JOHN GALLIANO and JACOBIM MUGATU

Jacobim is tall, dry and incredibly affected. He's wearing
full KABUKI MAKEUP and a black plastic suit. He speaks with
an UNSPECIFIED EUROPEAN ACCENT that changes constantly

throughout the film. Also, from scene to scene, his clothes
will become more and more outrageous.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

GALLIANO
You've outdone yourself this season Jaco.
Bold, nasty undergarments, with a touch
of sentimentality. Bravo.

JACOBIM
_The things we to to entice the K-Mart
shopper. I‘m lucky if I can see a profit
this fiscal yea: with that Filipino Yen
Playing hice the salami with my ass. Not
to mention getting the shelf space.
(nods to Antonio)

That's why I gotta stick that monkey on
My boxes.

Galliano nods sadly in agreement.

BACK ON ANTONIO:

Dancing his heart out, he suddenly loses the beat for a
Moment, noticing....

A MAN, who looks totally out of place wearing a very
straight suit and tie.

Antonio stops dancing. His face whitens, he looks to the
front door.

Two BIG MEN IN SUNGLASSES take position in front of it.

The Man In The Suit gestures to Antonio, with a slight smile,
to join him. This seems to frighten him even more. He steps
down from the coffee table, backing away across the room.

The Man nods to the the Two Sunglass guys, who move toward
him.

BATHROOM

Antonio seeks refuge in the bathroom only to find TWO SEXY
FEMALE MODELS having sex in the empty bathtub. They see him
and beckon him in, he considers it a moment then turns away .

KITCHEN

Sweating, Antonio checks behind him as he moves through the
crowd. He bumps into...

MAURY BAULSTEIN, 55, a short, balding model agent, heavyset,
with lots of jewelry. Maury talks with a deep garment
salesmen tone. His mouth is full with a shrimp brochette.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

MAURY
There he is! The man of the hour...
What's wrong? You look agitated.

ANTONIO
No, I’m fine. I have tc go.

MAURY
It’s not everyday a thirty year old model
slash actor lands an underwear deal. T-
shirts maybe. I wedgied MUGATU’s ass on
this one. We're seeing ten cents on every
unit.

ANTONIO
I know.

MAURY
Yeah, yeah. I know, you know. You know
everything. Two years on Melrose place, I
bet you could cure cancer.

He gives Antonio a paternal pat on the butt. Antonio moves
away.

CUT TO:
EXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT

Antonio, now in a full on state of hysteria, steps out on to
the balcony, and looks over the railing, forty flights down
to the busy street below. He climbs on top of the railing.

The Man in the Suit and the Sunglass guys step to the

doorway, and stop when they see this. A crowd of partiers
starts to gather.

ANTONIO
(gesturing wildly)
I won't be your freak! I won't be your
mutant freak boy! !

The Man, not wanting to be noticed, shrinks back. He laughs
nervously, as if Antonio is crazy. Maury comes to the door,
as does Mugatu, and more partiers...
ANTONIO (cont’d)
I‘m not an animal! I have two legs, not
four!

The crowd reacts to his craziness, Mirmuring to each other.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

MAURY
He‘s whacked out on the crack cocaine.
I've seen this before. Come down from
there, Tony!

Antonio eyes glaze over, as if he is if he has moved on to

another plane, a tear rolling down his cheek... The MUSIC
INTENSIFIES...

ANTONIO
(straight to Mugatu and the
Man, very dramatic)
My face might be on your underwear -- but
Antonio Sabato Jr.’s soul has just been
taken off the market.

He takes a silent step backwards, plummeting toward the
ground.

The CROWD GASPS. The Man and the Sunglass Guys disappear.

CUT TO:
EXT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - NIGHT

Sabato comes flying towards us, his ass obliterating the
frame.

Folksy, Springsteenesque music comes up out of nowhere, as
the TITLES play over...

SUPER 8 HOME MOVIES CIRCA MID-'70'S

An extremely good looking MOTHER and FATHER are taking their
two TWIN 5 YEAR OLD SONS on a day trip.

The parents waking the children while it’s still dark.

Loading the station wagon. One son constantly poses for the
camera, the other holds a plastic guitar.

Stopping for lunch at Denny’s. The poser brother stares at
his reflection in a spoon. The guitar brother pretends to
Play a tune while the parents clap and cheer. The poser looks
over jealously at the attention his brother gets. He seems
sad, in his own world.

Mt. Rushmore. The family waves to the camera -- all except

the poser, who seems enamored of the giant chiseled faces of
the former presidents. As the camera lands on him

MATCH CUT TO:
EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - PRESENT DAY -- EVENING

A fully grown DEREK ZOOLANDER shoots his “Blue Steel’ look
right through us as he swaggers up the star-clogged red
carpet towards the entrance to the VH1 Fashion Awards.

Everyone is there from MADONNA to DEMI, from CALVIN KLEIN to
DONATELLA VERSACE.

TITLE TYPES ON SCREEN:
VE1 FASHION AWARDS, NEW YORK CITY
Derek clowns around with DAVID BOWIE for the FASHION TV crew.

MUGATU emerges from a limo, wearing a hoop skirt frame over

biker spandex. He passes Bowie and Derek, who are being
interviewed by separate crews...

REPORTER
(to David)
Are you performing tonight?

DAVID
No, I’m strictly here to watch Derek win
his fifth consecutive Male Model of the
Year award.

Cutting through the limos, a primer black customized and
beached-out 73 FORD BRONCO pulls up. THREE MODELS and a
blonde, waify looking MALE MODEL pour out. The flashbulbs go
crazy, all for the Beck-like looker in the paisley shirt.

REPORTERS
Hansel! Over here! Hansel!

He smiles a laid back grin, but doesn’t stop. He has a yo-yo,
which he plays with as he passes Derek, whom he doesn’t
acknowledge. Derek returns the favor.

REPORTER
Are you worried about Hansel, Derek?

DEREK
Not as much as I’m worried about Gretel.

Derek smiles weirdly at his joke.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

DEREK (cont ‘d)
But seriously, my dream cc 7e true would
be that there's a four-way tie tonight.

REPORTER _
You mean, five-way tie, don’t you?

Derek pauses, looks around for a moment, then moves off.

CuT TO:
INT. FASHION AWARDS - LATER

The awards show is almost over. The hest, ALEC BALDWIN, is
at the podium.

ALEC

Welcome back. And before we present the
final two nominees for Male Model of the
Year, I'd just like to ask for a moment
of silence as we send all our leve and
healing thoughts to Mr. Antonio Sabato
Jr, who is fighting the fight of his life
as we speak.

(closing his eyes, tearful)
We're with you hot stuff.

The erowd applauds.

ALEC (cont'd)
Back to business. Here are the final two
nominees for Male Model of the Year.

HANSEL VIDEO MONTAGE

Beck's LOSER plays over a slickly edited series of images of
the blonde and beautiful HANSEL.

Hansel in different runway shows, wearing a thong only...

ANNOUNCER
Hot. Young. Brash. With more covers in
his first year than any rookie model

ever, and an attitude that says...

He gives the camera the finger, we FREEZE FRAME, but it’s
adorable, cause he’s Hansel...

ANNOUNCER (cont ‘d)
...Who cares! It's only fashion!

HANSEL
Hey, if somebody wants to snap my
picture, that's their trip. I’m just
along for the ride. Right now, me and my
friends are into crater-luging...

Hansel and his grunged out yet beautiful buddies luge down
the inside of a rocky volcano crater...

HANSEL (cont'd)
If modeling can buy me an extra twelve
feet of bungee cord, I’m ahead of the
game. Know what I mean? It’s all good.

Hansel at a photo shoot, surrounded by BEEKEEPERS in full

gear, wearing a COAT OF LIVE BEES, looking beautiful for the
camera...

ANNOUNCER
Hansel!

ON DEREK

He watches uneasily in the audience, checking out the crowd’s
reaction.

Behind him Hansel plays with his yo-yo, soaking in the
applause.

DEREK VIDEO MONTAGE

Techno music pounds over slick images of Derek doing
different photo shoots -- holding a poodle, wearing a fur,
oozing modelness -- the complete opposite energy of Hansel.

ANNOUNCER

Over the past decade male modeling has
had a shadow over it. That shadow has
been cast by one man, and five
syllables...

(with reverb, spoken to a

pounding beat)
DER-REK~-ZO0O-LAND-DER! !!

DEREK

I guess the look I’m best known for is
“Blue Steel’...

Derek flashes “Blue Steel" to camera with a lateral shift of
his neck.

ON THE CROWD

They break into applause. Derek looks relieved.

BACK TO VIDEO

DEREK (cont’d)
But I’m also known for ‘Ferrari’ -- which
is a much softer look...

He flashes *Ferrari* -- the exact same look as “Blue Steel’.

DEREK (cont’d)
Blue Steel is much more aggressive --
Ferrari, I save that for softer work,
like gloves and socks...

Derek at a photo shoot with a PHOTOGRAPHER, who is treating
him like a piece of meat, moving his face as if he is a
mannequin.

DEREK (cont’d)
My face is my instrument. I use it the
same way a cowboy would use his...
(makes lassoing gesture)
Or a nurse would use her... hat.

Derek in SAD CLOWN MAKEUP, turning a giant industrial wheel,
covered in grease...

ANNOUNCER
Four time winner of the most prestigious

honor that any male model would kill
for....Zoolander! -
ON THE PODIUM
As the crowd reacts, Alec Baldwin opens the envelope.

ALEC
And the award goes to...

TIGHT SHOT OF DEREK
He seems supremely confident and scared shitless.

We TRACK to HANSEL, who seems oblivious, doing “Walk the Dog’
on his yo-yo for his seat mate.

ALEC

ON DEREK

He gets up, assuming he’s won.

ON ALEC

ALEC
--sel!

ON THE CROWD

Oohs, aahs, and cheers at the huge upset.

DEREK

is caught standing up as the realization that he lost hits
him. For a moment he looks stunned, and then quickly begins

Clapping as hard as he can, going into standing ovation
mode...

Hansel looks around, mildly surprised, casually high fives
some buddies around him and heads to the stage, passing
Derek, who looks lost and scared.

CUT TO:
EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN -- SIDE DOOR -- NIGHT
Derek bursts out of the theatre, leaving the awards show

early. He is forlorn. He walks over to the street, gazes at
his reflection in a mud puddle as he hails a cab.

(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED:

DEREK
(to himself)
Who am I?

He becomes fascinated with the distorted image of himself in
the puddle, and bends down like Narcissus, touching his

finger to the reflection. Just as he does so, a LIMO pulls up
splattering him with mud.

A group of female models lead by LINDA EVANGELISTA and
BRIDGET HALL come running out the side door, into the car.

LINDA

Come out with us, Derek.
DEREK

I can’t.
LINDA

We're going to do a bunch of blow then go
skinny-dipping in Donald Trump's pool.
It’ll be fun.

BRIDGET
Yeah, come with us!

DEREK

I really can’t. I’ve got a lot of things
to ponder.

Hansel pops his head out of the limo, with Linda on his lap.
HANSEL
Don’t think too hard, amigo. It's all
good.

The door closes on their laughing faces and speeds off. The
mud, mixed with tears drips off Derek's face.

He walks down the street, into the night.

INT. DEREK'S SOHO LOFT -- EARLY MORNING

He shuffles inside, locking the door behind him. As he passes
by the mantle piece, he Stops and looks at the FOUR VH1 MODEL
OF THE YEAR AWARDS, and the empty FIFTH SPOT. He fingers the
empty space sadly.

BEDROOM

CONTINUED:

Derek opens the door quietly. We reveal that there are two
sets of bunk beds. His three male model roommates BRINT,
RUFUS and MEEKUS, sleep soundly in their beds, each with
their names on them.

Derek falls onto his bottom bunk, feeling alone. He lies
there for a long moment then...

. BRINT
I just have one thing to say...

Brint Rufus and Meekus simultaneously pop their heads out of
the sheets, Meekus being upside down from the bunk on top.

BRINT/RUFUS/MEEKUS
Hansel can kiss our ass!

Derek breaks into a huge grin, buoyed by his friends support.

DEREK
You guys!

CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

They are all in work out clothes, wearing tank tops that say
B’ALLS MODELS.

Rufus is on his cell phone checking his pager. So is Meekus.
Brint is doing sit-ups on a Roman chair. Derek gazes at his
own reflection in a spoon. During this conversation, no one
actually looks at each other.

RUFUS
I‘d be happy to even be a finalist for
male model of the year even once.

MEEKUS
I’m telling you, the whole thing’s fixed.

BRINT
Yeah right, Meekus. You and your
conspiracies. Like that idea you had that
someone was spying on us.

MEEKUS
I’m telling you Brint, someone is spying
on us. I was taking a shower last week
and my loofah was damp -- and no one had
been home all night.

(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:

BRINT
Loofahs are supposed to be damp. That’s
why they’re called loofahs.

MEEKUS
Come on Derek, tell them how you found
that little camera in the ceiling fan.

Derek shrugs, still gazing into the Spoon.

RUFUS
Oh please. Every apartment I’ve ever
lived in has had a camera in the ceiling
fan. It’s part of being a model. People
will do anything to see us naked.
(reading his pager)

Hey! There’s a party tonight!
Everyone brightens, save Derek.

DEREK
Do you ever think that maybe there's
something more to life than being really,

really, really, super, super, super, good-
looking?

They consider this for a moment, then, pretty much in unison,
shakes their heads, *No.°

During this, the CAMERA SLOWLY FALLS BELOW THE TABLE to
reveal a small MICROPHONE, taking in the conversation.

MEEKUS
What do you mean, Derek?

Meekus nonchalantly tries to see his own reflection in
Derek‘s spoon.

DEREK
I don’t know, do you ever feel like we

should be doing something more meaningful
with our lives?

BRINT
Like what?

DEREK
You know, like helping people?

MEEKUS
What people?

(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED: (2)

DEREK
(confused)
People that... need help...

RUFUS

Moljels help people. They give them a good
self image.

MEERUS
Yeah,

DEREK
That’s true...

BRINT

Hey Dude, I know what you need.

He jumps off the Roman Chair and tosses the towel playfully
at Rufus, who flips his cell phone closed and Playfully
tosses the towel at Meekus.

RUFUS MEEKUS BRINT
JAMBA JUICE!

WHAM'S TIMELESS HIT “WAKE ME UP BEFORE YOU GO-GO" KICKS IN...

CUT To:
EXT. CONVERTIBLE -- pAy

The male models, now dressed in elegant summer Casuals, are
cruising ina restored, cherry apple red convertible T-bird.
They pull in to a gas station, GROOVING To THE MUSIC...

GAS PUMP

Meekus pumps gas while Derek cleans the windshield. Derek
Playfully flicks the wet Squeegee at Brint and Rufus. They
hop out and arm themselves with squeegees as well, and,
before you can say “Dior turn,’ a male model romp is on.

SLOW MOTION

The boys flinging sudsy sponges at each other, all of them
getting soaked to the skin.

Things escalate to another level when Rufus takes the

GASOLINE HOSE and douses Meekus and Brint with super
unleaded.

Meekus returns the favor in kind. The frivelity winds down,
all four of them weak from laughter and horseplay.

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:

Meekus sighs and takes a cigarette from out of the glove
compartment. He places it in his mouth, and produces a
lighter.

SUPER SLO MO as the MUSIC DISTORTS
Meekus striking the fiint...

Derek lunging towards leekus to knock the cigarette from his
mouth...

DEREK
(slowed down)
Nooooooe! !!

Meekus looks up, meeting Derek's eyes just hundredths of a
second before he’s engulfed in flame...

Derek is knocked back by the explosion. He watches in horror
as, in quick succession...

Meekus, Brint and Rufus cateh fire. All three of them,

cloaked in flame, run around the gas station screaming for
help as...

Derek stands by, helpless, crushed.

SLOW FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP:

EXT. FLORAL HILLS CEMETERY - DAY

Derek is giving the eulogy at the triple male model funeral.
There are easily over one hundred sharply dressed male models

in attendance. MAURY is there, with an incredibly hot MODEL
CHICK.

DEREK
Rufus, Brint and Meekus were like
brothers to me. And I don’t mean
*brother’ like someone who is your actual
brother. JI mean “brother” like the way
black people use it, which is more
meaningful, I think.

About fifty feet behind the mourners, THE MAN IN THE SUIT
FROM THE OPENING PARTY watches hidden behind a marker.

DEREK (cont'd)
. When God calls one of us away, or in
this case, two of us....

CONTINUED:

DEREK (cont'd)
or three of us, actually, now that I
count the coffins, he or she does so
because he or she, needs us more in
heaven than on earth. And, if nothing
else, heaven just got a whole lot cuter.
And also, earth is going to get a lot
less cute too. And also, due to all the
really bad things that have happened

lately, I have decided to stop being a
male model.

The CROWD REACTS in shock, especially Maury.

CUT TO:
EXT. B'ALLS MODELS BUILDING -- MIDTOWN -- DAY

Maury and Derek walk into the building, Maury eating a hot
dog.

MAURY
(pissed)
You're overreacting! Three faggottinis
catch the wrong end of a duraflame and
all of a sudden you wanna throw away a
career? Who the hell has a gasoline

fight, anyway? What the hell were they
thinking?

INT. B'ALLS MODELS -- LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

They enter the reception area, heading towards Maury’s
office. The halls are filled with BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.

DEREK
I’m turning in my tear book, Maury. I
want to do something meaningful with my
life.

MAURY
You know what’s meaningful? The crack of
that chick's ass I was with at the
funeral. I’m telling you, you stick your
nose as deep as you want into the crack
of that eighteen year old ass and it
smells like roses. Deep as you want.

DEREK
I’m serious.
MAURY

So am I. I don’t get it, you quit, then
what? .

(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:

DEREK
The other day, I was thinking of
volunteering to help underprivileged
children learn how to read... and just
thinking about it was the most rewarding
experience of my life.

Tiey enter...

MAURY’S OFFICE

It is filled with modelling agency stuff and has a great view
of Manhattan. Maury sits behind his huge desk and turns on
his computer. Derek sits across from him,

Throughout the scene he fiddles with the computer.

MAURY
What about me, huh? What happens to

B'alls? What do I do? Sell churros on the
street?

DEREK
You’ll be fine.

MAURY
Alright, fuck me. What about us? I
thought we had a connection here. I've
always considered you like a...

DEREK
son?

MAURY
Yeah, whatever. I mean, we built this
place together. When I met you, you were
a Junior Petite who didn’t know Jean Paul

Gaultier from Long John Silver. Now look
at you.

Derek looks down, ashamed.

MAURY (cont‘d)
All the nights you spent on my couch
crying about how you can’t turn left...

DEREK
(defensive)
I can turn left.

MAURY
Derek, please. Some male models go left
at the end of a runway, others go right.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED: (2)

MAURY (cont'd)
You're a right turner. Nothing to be
ashamed of.

DEREK
I can go left.

MAURY
Bullshit.

DEREK
It’s true.

MAURY

Alright, baby wants to Play? Prove it.

Derek gets up and finds some runway room in the spacious
office. He prepares for a moment, then does a spectacular
walk to the end of the office. He pauses for a moment then
turns...right. It’s a beautiful turn.

Maury applauds politely. Derek does another perfect walk to
the other end of the office, begins a turn to the left, and
freezes.

A few awkward moments go by. Derek starts to shake, on the
verge of tears.

MAURY (cont’d)
Derek. Very few male models are ambi-
turners.

Derk finally shakes it off and goes to the wall. There are

two magazine covers framed on the wall: one Hansel, the other
Derek.

DEREK
(angrily)
Hansel is an ambi-turner.

MAURY
(sighing)
Here we go. I was wondering how long it
was going to take before you brought up
his name. You're mad I Signed Hansel.
-- That’s what all this is about, isn’t it?

Derek slumps into his chair. Maury crosses over in front of
the desk and sits down in front of Derek.

MAURY (cont‘d)
Lemme tell you something. There is only
one Zoolander. You hearing this? There is
only one person on this whole planet who
can do *Blue Steel‘. am tI right?

(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED: (3)

Derek doesn't look up, but nods.

MAURY (cont'd)

Now, gimme one. Come on. One Blue Steel,
Do it.

Derek can’t bring himself. Maury gets in his face.

MAURY (cont‘d)
Come on. Do it. Do it. Do it.
(a long beat, almost
threatening)
Do it.

Finally a sad, yet gallant Derek flashes his smoldering look.

MAURY (cont’d)
(smiling)
There he is! That's the male supermodel I
know. Now get outta here.

DEREK
Okay. But I‘m serious. I need to take
some time off. Maybe go home. Figure
things out.

MAURY
(laughing a bit too hard)
Yeah, you do that. Go, figure it all out.
And when you do, tell me how the hell to
get the free porn on the internet. Cause
I'll be damned if i'm giving them my
credit card to play with!

Derek stands, they hug.

DEREK
I love you, Maury.
MAURY
Yeah, yeah.

Maury pushes him out, shutting the door. He returns to his
desk, takes a phone out from his bottom desk drawer.

He picks up the receiver and waits a few seconds. His
demeanor becomes very serious.

Oh, that guy. He’s not gonna go Sahato

Struggling with his bags.

ZOOLANDER HOME

It is a traditional farmhouse, except fer the fact that it is

in the shadow of the impressive peaks of Mount Rushmore,
which loom in the background.

Derek’s mother, SUNNY, a very pretty older woman, leans out
of a window.

SUNNY
Derek? Is that you? My Baby!

DEREK
Hey, Mom!

Sunny shuts the window and runs downstairs to greet her son.
She emerges from the front door and hugs him.

SUNNY
Look at you. You look so skinny! Don’t
they have food in New York City?

DEREK
(Puzzled)
Yes, they do.
SUNNY
Oh, Derek.

Well, you’re getting a mouthful tonight.
Your brother and father are going to be
so happy to see you!

SUNNY
Thank you, honey.

LARRY

To what do we owe the privilege? I
figured you'd be off God knows where

DEREK
It's Male modeling. And I've decided to
quit.

Derek waits for his family to react.

LARRY

Your brother’s performing tonight, Derek.
We’re all going out to watch him.

DEREK
Did anyone hear what I said?

SUNNY
Of course. Good for you, sweetheart. If
that’s what you want. We can all go see
your brother’s show tonight and
celebrate. He's added songs from the new
album.

TIM

inspired by the new album, Ma. The
lawyers were very explicit about that.

There comes a time in every man’s life
when he reaches a fork in the read, and
he’s got to decide which way to go. You
came to that fork, and you made that
decision. I gotta respect that.

LARRY
That’s real well put, Tim. I'm proud of
you.

He looks at Derek, as if he's about to say something, and
eats a green bean instead. Derek runs to his bedroom in
tears.

SUNNY
(to Larry)
Couldn’t you have at least acted like you
were happy to see him?

LARRY
I‘ma farmer, not an actor.

TIM
(as Springsteen)
Many a time a man finds himself thrust on
to the world stage, not knowing his
lines, or his motivation...

SUNNY
Not now, Tim.

Derek's walls are covered with pictures of fashion magazines
from the seventies, along with posters of good-looking bad
actors from the seventies like Burt Reynolds, Jan-Michael
Vincent, Michael Sarrazin, Bruce Jenner, etc.

Tim's side of the room is entirely plastered with Springsteen
pictures.

Derek weeps into his pillow. Sunny lets herself in.

SUNNY
That's not true. He just doesn’t approve
of... male models.

DEREK

If he doesn't approve of male models, why
isn't he happy that I‘m quitting?

This stumps Sunny.

SUNNY
He's a complicated man, Derek.

INT. ZOOQLANDER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

Larry is watching a college basketball game, drinking a beer.
Derek comes down stairs, and hesitantly sits next to him.

DEREK
Who’s winning?

LARRY
State.

Derek nods, pretending to understand.
ON THE TELEVISION
The game goes to commercial -- and it is...

Derek's “Obsession” ad. Derek appears to be naked, swimming
through clouds over a crashing surf. It is very artsy.

DEREK ON TV DUBBED WITH
ANOTHER ACTOR’S VOICE
She’s getting away... I must catch her...

ON LARRY AND DEREK

It couldn't be more awkward. Even Derek feels embarrassed.
After a horrendously long beat, Sunny comes in with jackets.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

Derek, Larry and Sunny are in the front row of the packed
house. Tim is onstage, dressed as the Eighties Springsteen,
singing “Shopping Cart* to the tune of “Hungry Heart.

Derek watches grugingly. His parents have their hands in the
air, singing along. :

TIM
Everybody’s got a shopping cart,
everybody's got a shopping cart, lay down
your credit card and pay for your part,
everybody's got a sho-0-o-ping cart. Ooh
yeah...

He finishes the song, and Larry applauds wildly. Derek
watches his Dad give Tim all this love and support and can’t
help but feel sad.

TIM (cont'd)
(talking)
Yeah, shopping is something that
Americans like to do. Go to the mall,
buy things, even when they don’t need
nothin’. Just buy it, you know what I
mean?

Derek’s cell phone rings. Larry looks at him as if to say
“how could you?"’. Derek goes off with the phone.

MAURY
You're going to be richer than me.

DEREK
Maury, I was serious, I think it’s over

MAURY

Yeah, right, and I’m Tara Lipinski. You

DEREK
I’m not kidding.

MAURY
Well, somebody better tell Jacobim
Mugatu. He says you’re the only face for
his new campaign.

DEREK
Really?
(a beat)
No, Maury I can’t...

DEREK

wouldn't listen. Oh, I mentioned the
little kids who can’t read and he says
he'll build you a center, you know to
tutor them or whatever the fuck.

DEREK
(brightening)
Are you joking?
- MAURY
What am I, shovelling shit up your ass?

Of course it’s for real. But you gotta go

MUGATU himself is dressed and made up in full Maori tribesmen
tattoos and a miniskirt.

MUGATU

subway by an oily stranger. Do you
understand me? Yes, there is a clothing

table book, blah blah blah, so what! I
DON’T CARE!

Jacobim quickly sketches something on an electronic pad.
Instantly, a beautiful, colored sketch appears on a huge,
brilliant computer monitor.

The sketch is of Derek, dressed as a ninja bearing nun-chuks,

a machine gun and a sabre, wearing a decidedly flamboyant
outfit.

MUGATU (cont'd)
Are you “Assassine’?

Derek struggles to look like he knows what the word means. He
starts to answer, but Mugatu continues.

MUGATU (cont'd)
Am I crazy, Derek? Maybe. The question
is, do you want to dance in the Places
where a little elf named “genius” hangs
his pointy cap?

DEREK
No offense Mr. Mugatu, but you never
hired me before, and I've been around for-

MUGATU
Yes! Yes, around and around! And I wanted
nothing of you! And now I cannot have you

Mugatu gets up and hits a button on his desk. Sloane and
Matilda walk in, dressed in conservative business attire.

SLOANE

Welcome aboard, Derek. I’m Hayden Sloane.
I‘ll be the creative director on the
campaign. And let me tell you, we've got
some kooky ideas.

MATILDA :
I‘m Matilda Jeffreys. I'11 be handling

you need.

DEREK
Oh, okay. You mean like getting my

moisturizers? I guess you know all about
my chafing problem.

MATILDA

Right...

MUGATU
Your life is about to change, Derek. We
are going to create a new way of

MATILDA
I‘ll pick you up in two hours at your
hotel. Bring a bag.

DEREK
Where are we going?

Mugatu places his fingers to his lips.

MUGATU
Shhhh. From this point on, you can know
very little, Derek. You are going on a
journey of the soul, a transformation of
your entire physical and spiritual
essence. You must become “Assassine’.

A military jeep pulls up and a couple of BIG GUYS in uniforms
with Mugatu logos grab their bags and throw them in the jeep.

A sunburnt ex-marine, CHET MENGERS, approaches. He is also in

Chet gets behind the wheel. Derek looks to Matilda, who won't
look him in the eye. She gets in the passenger seat. Derek
goes to get in the back. Chet starts the engine.

CHET
Hold it. We're a little full up in here,
scumfuck. Why don’t you run behind the
vehicle, get your appetite up for dinner?
It’s only seven clicks to the west.

The jeep pulls out. On the backside of it, Staring at Derek,

in his full Prada suit.

Derek struggles to keep up with the car through the dense
underbrush, ripping off articles of clothing in the
sweltering heat.

Matilda looks back over her shoulder then turns to Chet.

MATILDA

CHET
Rough? I got a rocket up my ass from your
boss informing me not to have another
fubar-sit like the Sabato Jr. meltdown.
Okay, lady? I got ten days to rip him
down, empty out what little there is in

barbed wire. Huge concrete walls give the structure a very
unfriendly, bunker-like atmosphere.

Derek follows after the jeep, limping along, covered in mud
and scratches.

CUT TO:
EXT. MAIN BUILDING -- DAY

The jeep pulls to a stop, followed by Derek, who drops to his
knees. He is Staring right at the picture of the smiling
Malaysian man. Chet Squats down in front of him.

CHET

you? Look at that face. He’s responsible.

D:

Who is he?

CHET
He's nothing. He is X. He has no
children, he has no mother. He is a virus
infecting the earth. All bad things
relate to him. He is your pain.

DEREK
Oh.

CHET
Jeffreys will put you in your hut. I’ll
see you in twenty at dinner, fuckface.

He boots a load of sand in Derek’s face. Matilda watches him

DEREK
Wait a minute. Can't 12 take a shower? I

MATILDA
No time. Let’s go.

There’s not even a mirror in here!

MATILDA

Let’s go!
DEREK

This is ridiculous. My hair is all messed
up and I’m sweating. I can’t go to dinner
like this. I thought your job was to help
me.

Matilda turns to him.

; MATILDA
Look, let’s get something straight. I
don‘t like models. I think they're vain,
"stupid, and incredibly self centered.

DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
It has a tropical flavor, bamboo and chimes.

SERVANTS serve huge portions to the diners, who are: Matilda,
Chet, Derek and a balding small man in a dark suit and thin

tie. He has piercing eyes, and a weird Manipulative demeanor.
He is DR. LINDENLAUB.

DR. LINDENLAUB
...and that’s how Mr, Mugatu was able to
establish our research facility here,
Derek. But it’s mainly his winter
getaway. It’s just a fun spot to relax
and also do some research.

DEREK
What kind of research, Dr. Lindenlaub?

At this point, a SERVANT, who is incredibly handsome, sets
down a plate in front of Derek. The servant is perfect,
except that he has three nostrils. Derek takes this in,

DR. LINDENLAUB
This and that. Just fun psychological and
genetic stuff,

DEREK
I'm really hungry.

Derek looks down at his plate. In contrast to all the other's

hearty portions, he only has two pieces of lettuce. He
scarfs them down.

The clean plate reveals the SMILING MALAYSIAN MAN staring up
at him.

Chet leans over and looks at the plate.
CHET

Seems that smiling old sack of crap
doesn’t want you to @at too much.

DR. LINDENLAUB
Perhaps you’re feeling a certain
hostility towards the man on your plate
who won‘t let you eat. a desire to hurt
him wouldn't be wrong, Derek. In fact, it
would be completely understandable.

Derek tries to figure out what is going on. Chet looks to
Matilda, to chime in and help. She does so, reluctantly.

MATILDA
Uhh, the Malaysian man is bad, Derek.

There is a lull. After a long beat...

the Smiling Malaysian.

Derek lays on his mat, Staring at the light bulb. He gets up
and tries to turn it off, but he can’t fina a switch. He
looks very tired, lonely and hungry.

He pulls a spoon from his shirt that he stole from the dinner
table. He forlornly looks at his reflection.

A branch cracks outside his window. He looks out and sees
the rear of a small donkey. Derek smiles.

. DEREK
Hello, Mr. Donkey. Are you as lonely as I
am?

The donkey looks back, and Derek sees that it has the face of
male model superstar MARK VANDERLOO.

Startled, Derek jumps back. The donkey runs away, braying a
half donkey half human wail.

keeping the door as Closed as possible.

MATILDA (cont’d)

DEREK

I just saw a donkey with Mark Vanderloo’s
face. It was horrible:

MATILDA
Wait a minute. Calm down. Mark who?

DEREK
Vanderloo -- the supermodel ?

He peers over her shoulder.

DEREK (cont’@)
You have a bed?

MATILDA
Look, it’s been a long day. Your eyes

were probably playing tricks on you. Get
some sleep, okay?

Derek rubs his eyes. He thinks a moment.

DEREK

I'm telling you I saw a donkey with Mark
Vanderloo’s face!

MATILDA
Derek, that‘s the stupidest thing I ever
heard. Now go back to your hut.

DEREK
Did you see that waiter at dinner? He had
three noses.

existence.

MATILDA

(dropping her front a bit)
Why are you here?
~ DEREK
Mugatu said he would build the Derek

that how you’d typically define a “failed

Standard thought control procedures used

Did Lindenlaub do something to you?

Derek finishes the equation and turns to her.

DEREK
From what I can gather, I'm being trained
for some sort of covert operation that
you and Sloane are spearheading. And it’s
clear that Mugatu has some stake in the
outcome as well. If my brain functions

looks out the window. There is a sky full of stars.

DEREK

Look at all those stars. Did you know
that the amount of stars in the universe
is expanding at a rate that we are
incapable of calculating? There are so
many things that we don’t know.

What are you doing to me?

Matilda is dumbstruck. She is attracted to him for the first
time, drawn in.

MATILDA
I can‘t tell you. z mean, if I did...
well, it’s so incredibly complex...

DEREK
Matilda, right now, I am seeing things
that the eight percent of your brain that
you use could hardly begin to fathom.
Don’t for a moment believe that you can
comprehend the limits of my intellect.

MATILDA

speaks, he Slowly loses focus and starts to look at the
equation on the mirror.

Excited whispers pass through the hip crowd. A small “Kids’

Pounding, arms flailing, eyebrows working overtime.

He reaches the end of the runway, feeling proud of himself.
Now, it’s Hansel’s turn. It’s like H-O-R-S-E. Hansel must

Pothead Model passes out.

Triumphant, Derek collapses into. the arms of his cheering

MATILDA (cont'd)
Just listen to me, okay? You've been
trained to kill the President of Malaysia
because he wants to raise the minimum
wage of the sweatshops in his country by
five hundred percent. Mugatu knows that
if this happens he’ll be driven out of
business.

DEREK
What are you talking about?

MATILDA

Derek, they killed Meekus, and they're
going to kill you.

CONTINUED: (3)

DEREK
They didn't kill Meekus. Meekus died in
@ preventable, albeit unfortunate, gas
Station/convenience store accident.

MATILDA
Think about that accident, Derek. Go
back to the moment when Meekus put the
cigarette in his mouth. Isn't it true
that he hadn‘t yet struck the flint when
the explosion occurred?

Derek thinks hard.

EXT. GAS STATION -- DEREK‘’S DREAMY FLASHBACK -- DAY
ALL SLO MO and very STYLIZED -- glittery and ..

Rufus, Meekus, and Brint are all drenched in gasoline.
Meekus reaches for the pack of cigarettes in the glove box.

At the moment of ignition, we see indeed that Meekus’ lighter
indeed has not been lit.

Instead, a BLACK GLOVED HAND holding an acetylene torch
enters the frame, igniting the blaze.

CUT TO:
INT. DEREK'S DRESSING ROOM

Derek is disturbed by the memory, not wanting to it to be
true.

MATILDA
They killed Meekus because he knew your
place was bugged.

DEREK
No, no, you're wrong. You’re saying this
because you're jealous of models, and
you're bitter because you still have to
work at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

MATILDA
Uhh! You drive me crazy!

She slaps him across the face really hard. Suddenly, his

eyes turn from doe-eyed and dreamy, to sharp and intelligent.
She takes another look at him...

CONTINUED:

MATILDA
Derek, are you alright?

DEREK

(smart voice)
I was just processing what you said. It
makes perfect sense. President Ferdinand
and his forward thinking policies can
only spell trouble for Mugatu, whose work
force is made up solely of third worle
labor.

MATILDA

Did my slap trigger the effects of the
“smart drug’?

DEREK
That would seem to be the logical
conclusion.
There is a loud knock on the door.

STAGE MANAGER (0.S.)
We're ready, Derek! Places everyone!

DEREK

Wish me luck. I'm going to need it.
MATILDA

Whatever you do, don’t shoot the

President.

Matilda goes to Derek, and caresses his cheek where she
Slapped him. He locks eyes with her. They kiss.

DEREK
Don’t worry. Everything will be okay.

BACKSTAGE AREA
Matilda comes out and runs right into Sloane and Mugatu.

SLOANE
How is he?

MATILDA
(gives a bold thumbs up)
He’s ready.
DEREK’S DRESSING ROOM

He stares into the mirror, Starting to lose his smarts.

DEREK
Remember. Remember. Re...

He looks around the room frantically. He finds a POST IT and
a pen.

BACKSTAGE AREA
Mugatu knocks o: the door.

MUGATU
Are you ready, Assassine? Did you put on
your new butt thong that I made
especially for you?
Derek emerges from the door, looking as dumb as ever.

DEREK
It’s on. Snug like a bug in a rug.

MUGATU
Then let’s blow some People away!

Matilda looks at Derek. He seems not to acknowledge a thing.

CUT TO:
INT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY -- NIGHT

It is packed. Hanging from the rafters are “ASSASSINE’
banners, and giant Photos of Derek as Assassine.

The runway is lined with the very same stars and political
figures we saw as cut-outs back on the island. Ferdinand sits
at the end, smiling, just like in the photos.

The lights go down, the music begins with an ominous Nine
Inch Nails vibe. Strobe lights buzz as...

MALE AND FEMALE MODELS hit the runway brandishing exotic
weaponry. It's like the Bob Fosse version of a Soviet
military parade.

We see the various reactions of the heads of state as they
enjoy the show,

Sloane and Matilda watch from near the bank of PHOTOGRAPHERS
at the end of the runway.

Ominous looking SECURITY GUARDS are stationed all around the
runway, waiting for Derek to complete his mission.

IN THE WINGS

72.
CONTINUED:

Derek gives the model of front of him an encouraging pat on
the ass as she steps on the runway.

Derek is dressed in his full on, para-military uniforn,
holding two fully loaded, very real looking, Uzis. Mugatu
comes up behind him.

MUG’ TU
Some men are korn great. Others have

greatness thrust upon them. And the rest
become Assassine!

He gives Derek a gentle shove on to the runway.
RUNWAY -- DEREK'S POV -- SLOW MOTION
FLASHES go off. PEOPLE APPLAUD. He nervously glances from

side to side seeing all the same people from the

Simulation... John Major, Stephen Dorff, Boutros Boutros
Gali, ete.

Derek strides towards Ferdinand. The MUSIC FADES,replaced by
HEARTBEAT AND BREATHING sounds. . ;

THE SECURITY GUARDS

Finger their triggers...

DEREK —

His knuckles are white from gripping the Uzis. As he
approaches the end of the runway, he raises his weapons. His
view of the president Partially obscured by the FEMALE MODEL
in front of him.

watches intently ...

MUGATU

bites his knuckle, watching from the wings...

MATILDA

watching Derek’s face for some sign, and not getting

Derek's fingers squeeze the triggers simultaneously...
Then, something catches Derek's eye...

He notices something on the ASS of the model in front of
him...

There's a yellow POST IT stuck tere.

DEREK

squints his eyes, his lips moving as he reads it.
ZOOM INTO POST IT -- it reads:

“DEREK, JUST A REMINDER, DO NOT SHOOT THE PRESIDENT OF
MALAYSIA.

LOVE, DEREK?’
Just as he processes this, his fingers SQUEEZE THE TRIGGERS!
BUT -- Derek jerks the Uzis upwards, firing hundreds of

rounds into the ceiling, sending powder and small chunks of
Plaster onto the crowd.

THE ROOM ERUPTS into a frenzy... PHOTOGRAPHERS AND NEWS CREWS
DOCUMENTING IT ALL.

In a matter of split seconds:

SLOANE, seeing that it has gone bad, looks at Matilda then
immediately DIVES ONTO FERDINAND, seizing an opportunity to
be perceived as a hero.

The Security Guards aim their weapons at Derek, but just as
they fire off their rounds...

MATILDA LEAPS ONTO a confused DEREK, and they go rolling off
the runway just under a hail of bullets.

MUGATU curses from the wings and quickly disappears.
MATILDA AND DEREK

scurry to one of the exits she scoped out.

SERVICE HALLWAY

They bust through a door, running.

DEREK -

MATILDA
That was you, Derek.
DEREK
I don’t think so. My penmanship’s not

FOUR SECURITY GUARDS bust through the door in hot pursuit.
Derek pulls at his crotch and butt crack.

They round a corner. Matilda pulls over a metal shelf in the
hallway, creating a an obstacle behind then.

DEREK (cont'd)
You think we could stop a second? This
butt thong is killing me!

MATILDA
Later Derek, later!.

They are almost to the exit.

DEREK
You don’t understand. I have a really bad
chafing problem. It’s cost me work.

MATILDA
How would you like it to cost you your
life!

Now the guards are about thirty feet behind them, climbing
over the downed shelf.

DEREK
Please! I won't be able to run much
farther if this keeps up!

MATILDA
Are you nuts?

Derek, while he is running, expertly removes his pants and

the butt thong (though we don’t see the details)... Matilda
is amazed.
DEREK
I do this all the time. In remote
locations.

She looks back. The guards are getting closer. She pushes
open the exit door...
75.

EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE -- pay

They come out, looking for an escape route, Derek holding the
thong in his mouth.

She looks around -- no van!

Making a split second decision, she bolts down the street,
Derek in tow.

THE DOOR

The guards come busting out, right behind Derek and Matilda.
They train their guns on Derek.

As Derek and Matilda run across the busy street, a TAXI
almost hits them. They turn around, the guards are about ten
feet behind then, ready to fire.

Purely out of frustration and fear, Derek rolls the thong
into a ball and tosses it at them.

DEREK (cont’d)
Leave us alone!

BOOM! the thong explodes, taking out the guards.

Matilda looks to Derek, who shrugs. She opens the cab door
and pushes him in.

CUT TO:

MATILDA
Drive! Just drive fast.

They collapse in the backseat. The cab races into traffic.

DEREK

MATILDA
Are you crazy? We can’t go to your place.
They'll be waiting for you.

DEREK

MATILDA
Derek, this goes very deep. And Maury is

DEREK
But he... He's been like a father to me.
He got me my first Go-See.

Derek looks out the window, stunned.

MATILDA
I'm sorry. Right now we have to get off
the streets. They're going to do every
thing they can to make sure that everyone
in America thinks you are a psycho. We
need a safe house, just for a little
while, till I can figure a way to contact

Wendell.

I was supposed to meet Hansel after the

MATILDA

I thought you two hated each other.

DEREK
We made up.

MATILDA

DEREK
He's doing a shoot.

MATILDA

Hansel attempts to follow his direction. Derek waves, trying

MATILDA
Excuse me. Please shut up. We need to

HANSEL
Okay, okay... Crash at my place. I got

We have to go, now.

Hansel makes a split second decision.

HANSEL
Let‘s Rit it.

This dude has. stolen enough of my soul

They sneak off around the gate, and climb into a waiting Town
car. Hansel has trouble fitting his wings in and dumps them
in the street.

CuT TO:

EXT. DETENTION CENTER APARTMENTS -- NIGHT

The car pulls in front of a dark and dreary old Victorian
jail building. It is on the most bombed out looking street in
the East Village. A couple of CRACKHEADS hang outside.

They get out and go to the entrance. Hansel punches «a code

As they turn from the entrance into the living room, THREE
WAIF MODELS in their panties are doing impossible yoga
stretches, all ridiculously sexual.

The TV is blaring the news:

TV REPORTER

for the veteran male model’s aborted
attempt on the Malaysian President’s

As he speaks, the footage of the assassination attempt Plays
repeatedly.

The models look over to Derek, Hansel and Matilda
nonchalantly, still doing their poses.

This a room that has dirt all over the floor, and a sandbox

Starts a flashflood type stream down the middle.

HANSEL
I call this the soil room. Self

Matilda takes this in, then goes Straight for the phone.
Exhausted, Derek sits on the sandbox.

Hansel pulls out some ‘shrooms.

HANSEL (cont’d)
So Derek, what the hell is up? You tried
to kill that President of Malaysia, dude.

Matilda sits next to Derek on the bed.

DEREK
Did you get a hold of Wendell?

HANSEL

Who's Wendell? Shroom?

argument)
Easy Hansel, it’s all good.

MATILDA
{she takes a long beat)
Okay. What I‘m about to tell both of you
is extremely sensitive.

Derek and Hansel nod solemly.

MATILDA (cont’d)
Believe it or not, almost every political
assassination in the history of the world
has been performed by a male model.

DEREK
Why would they use male models as
assassins? ;

MATILDA
Three reasons, Extremely attractive
people can gain access to almost anywhere
solely because of their looks...

HANSEL
True.
(to Derek)
Dude, remember when we just blew right
into Nobu last week, no questions asked?

MATILDA (cont'd)

Virtually every assassination from
Lincoln and the cotton plantations to
Kernedy and his commitment to an

HANSEL
These Sherpas hook you up Derek. And if

Prewitt. We have to find him and convince

Sworn testimony, our case against Sloane

Prewitt fell off the face of the earth

DEREK
In all probability, Maury would have some
information as to his whereabouts.

MATILDA
Why would he be in contact with Maury?

DEREK
Prewitt was Maury’s first client. I think
it‘s safe to say, judging from both their
personality profiles, if Prewitt is
alive, he has had at least some contact
with Maury.

Why?
HANSEL

Maury shushes him again. He takes a magic marker from the

EXT. BROOKLYN PROMENADE --DUSK

Maury is jogging in a full on tacky velour sweatsuit. He

does that slow, jog-shuffle that's only slightly faster than
& walk.

# black TOWN CAR pulls up alongside him. The window comes
down. It's Sloane.

SLOANE
I never would have pegged you asa
fitness buff.

MAURY
Well, you do what you can...

SLOANE
Get in.

Maury keeps jogging.

MAURY
I'd love to, but I got my beats per
minute thing going here...

Mugatu sticks his head out of the other window. It is a bit
awkward.

MUGATU
I think you should get in the car
Baulstein.

Maury is- getting a little nervous. He picks up his pace. The

car stays with him, forcing others joggers and walkers to get
out of the way.

Maury tries to change his path, not quite running away but
definitely trying to lose them.

He does a strange “serpentine” pattern, that does nothing to
elude the car. The car follows this absurdly slow pattern.

Finally, frustrated with the ridiculousness of it, Sloane
jumps out and taps Maury on the shoulder.

MAURY
Alright, alright. I could use a sit
anyhow.

They get into the car.
95.

INT. TOWN CAR

Maury is wedged between Sloane and Mugatu. In the front are
the two SUNGLASS HENCHMEN. . ,

SLOANE

Hansel paid you a visit this morning.
MAURY

Yeah, big whoop. He's a client.
SLOANE

You told him where Prewitt was.
MAURY

(nervously)

Ho baby. That's a good one. I didn't tell
him nothin’.

MUGATU
Are you sure about that?

MAURY
Absolutely.

Mugatu hits a video remote and a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA VIEW of
Maury’s office Pops up on the screen.

ON TAPE we see Maury wildly gesticulating to Hansel where
Prewitt is.

MAURY (cont’d)
Look at me. Look at that gut...

Maury laughs sheepishly, beaten.

EXT. SOUTH DAKOTA ROAD -- DUSK
Title types on: RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA

We SWOOP DOWN towards a lone rental car on a road cutting
through beautiful cornfields.

CUT TO:
INT. RENTAL CAR - DUSK

Derek drives while Matilda looks at amap. They pull off
their makeup as they drive.

DEREK
What an incredible Coincidence that
Prewitt’s ostrich farm is only about ten
Miles from where I grew up

Derek jams on the brakes, then turns up a bumpy, dirt road,
marked with a battered old sign that reads *SHECHTER’S
OSTRICH ALLEY’.

EXT. OSTRICH FARM -- EVENING

They pull up in front of a big old farmhouse. Hundreds of
ostriches surround the car. It’s like “The Birds. «

A silhouetted figure peaks out from the lace curtained
window. After a moment, he emerges from the front door.

Matilda and Derek stay in the car, frightened of the birds.

They watch as the very plain looking, middle aged man
approaches.

D
Is that him?

MATILDA
He doesn’t look like much of a model.

DEREK
Wait till you see his hands.

He wades through the birds. Derek rolls down the window.

(leaning over)
Can I help you?

DEREK:
Excuse me, but are you J.D. Prewitt?

The man grimaces. He speaks in a low, weatherea@ whisper.

PREWITT
My name is Al Shechter. I don't know what
you're talking about. We're closed. You
best leave now. The birds will be
Sticking their heads in the sand for the
evening. Good day to you.

Derek and Matilda exchange a look. After a beat...

MATILDA
That's a pity. Our friend, Maury
in said vou Stay open late on
Fridays.

The man, who is J.D. Prewi.t, registers this.

INT. PREWITT’S FARMHOUSE - EVENING

The walls are covered with framed watch ads, men’s glove and
ring ads, all featuring J.D’s hands over the years. The only
other pictures are of ostriches.

In the kitchen, Prewitt puts some tea bags in cups and puts a
pot of water on the Stove, using his left hand, which is
normally aged and wrinkled.

However, his right hand, which he keeps permanently in a
portable, fully operative, HYPERBARIC CHAMBER, is unmarred,
supple and youthful.

He brings the tray over with his good hand. Derek and Matilda
notice the chamber. Derek subtly motions for Matilda not to
mention it.

PREWITT
I‘ve been waiting for someone to come. I
knew it would just be a Matter of time.
{after a beat, gravely)
You'll have to kill me. Ir won't go to
that island.

MATILDA
We don't want to you to go to that island
either.

PREWITT
You’re not from B'alls?

MATILDA
Just the opposite. I’m with the Justice
Department Mr. Prewitt.

He stares into the tea cup.
PREWITT

They wanted me to assassinate President
Ford. -

DEREK
We know.

PREWITT
2 couldn’t do it. My fingers were meant
for stroking ostriches and showing off
rings. Not taking the lives of clumsy
presidents.

MATILDA
Squeaky Fromme was the patsy, wasn't she?

PREWITT
(looking down)
A great lady.

MATILDA
Look, Mr. Prewitt, I don't want to waste
your time so I’m going to cut to the
chase. Will you testify against Hayden
Sloane and B'alls Models?

PREWITT
I don’t want to waste your time either,
so I’‘1l cut to the chase... Go to hell.

He goes to the refrigerator and pulls out three ridiculously
large ostrich eggs.

PREWITT (cont’d)
Who's hungry?

CUT TO:
LATER

Derek, J.D. and Matilda are seated around the large, stone
fireplace. They eat ostrich omelettes.

A couple of ostriches chase each other through the house as
they speak.

PREWITT
I’m sorry I can‘t help you, Ms. Jeffreys.
I made a promise to Maury a long time
ago. And I don’t intend to break it.

MATILDA
But Mr. Prewitt, you are the only person
who can do this. Maury Baulstein is as
guilty as the rest of them.

(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:

PREWITT
Be that as it may Ms.Jeffereys. I made a
Promise to my agent. And that bond, the
Male Hand Model/Agent Bond, is one that I
cannot break.

DEREK
I understand.

Derek and Prewitt exchange a knowing look. Prewitt looks him
over.

PREWITT
Zoolander. Zoolander. I guess I should
know your work. But I haven't opened a
magazine in years.

He holds up his Hyperbaric arn.

PREWITT (cont'd)
Things have changed for me.
(re: the ostriches)
These little buggers keep me plenty busy
most days.

MATILDA

Please Mr. Prewitt. We need you to come
forward. You are the only person who can--

PREWITT
(still looking at Derek)
Wait a minute, you‘re not related to...
No, you couldn't be... Ah, what the
hell... Hey, is there any chance you
might be related to Tim Zoolander?

DEREK
Tim Zoolander?

PREWITT
Yeah, you know, the Springsteen guy.

DEREK
He's my brother.

PREWITT

You do?

PREWITT

Hell, yeah! I'm from Asbury Park so like,
forget it. And we hardly get any Bruce-
alikes out here. Ah, you’re bullishitting
me, aren’t you? You’re not really his

brother!
DEREK
No, really, I am.
PREWITT
Can I meet him?
DEREK
I don’t think --
MATILDA
(interrupting)

Definitely. There’s a show tonight, isn’t
there Derek?

DEREK
I don’t know. But I don’t want to--

Prewitt goes in the other room and comes back excitedly,
holding a paper up.

PREWITT
There certainly is!
(reading)
Four Presidents Theater. If we get our
act together, we could make the third
show!

MATILDA
(playing as if she is excited)
Let’s go. I love the Boss toc! That’s a
great idea!

Prewitt lights up.

PREWITT
T‘ll go change.

He goes off excitedly, like a little kid. Derek sulks.

MATILDA
Derek, we have to get this guy to

testify.It’s our only chance. You know
that.

She comes up to him and puts her hand on his cheek.
MATILDA
Besides, it might be good for you to see
your family.

DEREK
Yeah, right. Maybe if I show up dressed
like Bon Jovi they'll love me.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

J.D., wearing an old “Zoolander IS The Boss” tour shirt,
comes bouncing out of the house. He dumps out a bag of
ostrich food on the ground.

PREWITT
That ought to hold ‘em for awhile. Let’s
kick it!

He gets in the car with Derek and Matilda.

EXT. FOUR PRESIDENTS THEATER - NIGHT

The marquee reads...TIM ZOOLANDER IS “THE BOSS"...A small
crowd is filtering in.

CUT TO:
INT. TIM’S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Classic Springsteen-style guitars, electric and acoustic, are
on stands.

Tim fiddles with his harmonica holder while he gets a
shoulder rub from his father, Larry.

There’s a tas on the dressing room door. Sunny goes to the

Larry won'

SUNNY
Oh, honey, are you all right? They're

President of some country. How
ridiculous...

DEREK
That‘s actually all true, Mom, but I can
explain. You see...

LARRY
No time. Tim here's got a show to do.
Right, Tim?

TIM
(Springsteen voice)
Daddy’s right.

LARRY
And in Tim’s show, there most likely
won‘t be any attempts on people’s lives.

Tim start to head out. Matilda stops them.

MATILDA
Excuse me. Hi I’m Matilda, I'ma friend

Sure thing. Hey, J.D., thanks for coming

J.D. raises his hyperbaric chamber to shake Tim’s hand.

PREWITT
I am your biggest...

LARRY
He's got a gun!

Sunny SCREAMS. Larry collapses on Tim like a secret service
agent.

MATILDA
It’s not a gun!

LARRY
What the hell is it?

DEREK
(duh)

It‘s a hyperbaric chamber to keep his
hand youthful and supple looking.

LARRY
Well, whatever it is, keep it the hell
out of my son‘s dressing room.

Larry gets up. Tim goes over to Derek.

TIM
Hey Derek, I jus’ wanna say I’m glad yer
okay and everything. Even if ya did try
to off that Malaysian fella.

LARRY

Come on son. Save your voice for the
show.

He drags Tim out, giving Derek an unhappy look. Matilda goes
with Prewitt who seems flustered yet happy.

Derek is left alone with his mother. Re fights back tears.

DEREK
He just doesn’t love me.

Sunny sits herself square in front of Derek.

SUNNY
-Oh Derek. My poor simple, simple, simple
boy. He loves you more than you will ever
know.

DEREK
Then why is he so cruel?

SUNNY
He wanted so much for you. The last thing
he wanted was for you to follow in his...

DEREK
What ?

Sunny looks at him for a moment then pulls out an old faded
black and white picture. She hands it to Derek.

It is Larry in a 1950's Sears catalogue, modeling ski wear.
He has a classic model's pose. Derek is shocked.

DEREK
Why didn’t he ever tell me?

SUNNY
Your father was very successful. Very. He
was the king of print ads. And then when
they started all that runway foolishness--
he was there in the beginning of all that
Derek... well, he had a problem.

DEREK
What?

SUNNY
Your father couldn’t turn...left.

Derek looks down.

SUNNY (cont'd)
It stopped his career cold. He knew it
was hereditary. There was a chance it
could skip a generation, but he didn’t
want you to have to go through the
humiliation. It broke his heart when you
did your first test shots.

DEREK
I never... Why didn’t he just tell me?

SUNNY
Like you would have listened. You may not
be too savvy in the brains department.
But when you fix on doing something, you
do it. I love you Derek. And so does he.

They hug, as Derek tries to process all this new information.

CUT TO:
EXT. PREWITT’S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The tranquillity of the country night is crushed by the sound
of a military issue HUM-VEE roaring up the dirt road.

It pulls up on the lawn directly in front of the front porch.
The ostriches scatter.

Sloane, Mugatu, and the Sunglass henchmen get out, weapons
drawn. Mugatu is wearing a headdress and Sari-type outfit
that wraps around him.

They peer through the windows. Seeing nothing, they kick
down the door.

INT. PREWITT’S FARMHOUSE -- A FEW MINUTES LATER
The four men tear through the house, looking for clues.

Mugatu notices something. He crosses to a NEWSPAPER open on
the kitchen table.

MUGATU
I’ve got something.

Sloane comes over.

SLOANE

Mugatu taps on the paper; an ad for Tim's show is circled,

MATILDA
We have to lose them. You must know these
roads like the back of your hand!
He looks at her blankly.
She slaps him. Nothing happens.
She hits him again. Again and again. Still nothing.
Now his face is bruised and bleeding -- he looks like Rocky.

PREWITT
Did he used to do the act around the

house? I wouldn’t have been able to deal
with it.

MATILDA
Over here! Pull off the road!

EXT. DIRT ROAD -- NIGHT

Derek pulls off, driving through rough terrain, in between
scattered trees.

The Hummer is on his ass.

Finally the trees break, and there is a clearing -- that is a
an abrupt drop off. The car skids to a halt.

Sloane and the henchmen run out, drawing their guns on the
rental car.

SLOANE
It’s over.

Derek, Matilda and Prewitt get out of the car. Sloane pushes

Matilda.

Mugatu watches, a bit removed from them.

SLOANE (cont'd)
You’re coming \ith us, Derek.

DEREK
No way, Sloane!

Derek backs up slowly to the edge of the road. He suddenly
stops, out of room. Mugatu laughs.

MUGATU
What is wrong, Derek?

WE PULL BACK BEHIND DEREK TO REVEAL that they are on top of
the MOUNT RUSHMORE MONUMENT, ON TOP OF LINCOLN’S HEAD.

SLOANE
We never wanted this to end badly, Derek.
Come with us and we'll set you up very
nicely on Chibbi Chibbi. You liked it
there, didn't you?

Derek shakes his head.

DEREK
I won’t be one of your mutant freaks!

MUGATU

But you seemed so carefree there. I think
it was the salt air.

Sloane signals to the henchmen, who produce a roughed-up

looking Maury, still in his jogging suit. Sioane puts the gun
to Maury’s temple.

DEREK
Maury?

PREWITT
Maury!

MAURY

You were like a father to me.

MAURY

Don’t you think I know that? People
think that selling your soul is something
you do over lunch, but, lemme tell you,
it’s more like a Jenny Craig type of
thing. It happens gradually.

SLOANE
Now, we can make this easy, or we can
make it hard.

DEREK

Let’s make it hard.

Derek moves to help Maury.

SLOANE (cont'd)
Another step and I shoct.

Derek stops.

MAURY
I don’t care. Shoot me. Blow my brains
so far out of my head that I can't
remember any of this crap. You tell ‘em
the truth, J.D. -- tell the world. It’s
too late for me now.

Prewitt tries to move to help him. Sloane cocks the gun.

MAURY (cont‘ 4d)
That's right. Blow me to kingdom come.
You heard me. Do it. Do it. Come on,
do it. Do it.
(almost threatening)
Do it.

Spooked, Sloane lets the gun fall away for a moment. In that
instant, Maury pulls something out of his back pocket.

MAURY (cont'd)
Hey, Derek. Remember this guy?

Maury slips on a paper mask of the smiling Malaysian
President.

200M in on DEREK -- he zeroes in on the mask and immediately
reverts back to ASSASSINE! He does a quick move into a roll,
Straight towards...

Sloane -- who panics. Maury is peeking right over Sloane’s
shoulder...

Derek attacks Sloane, in a series of JACK1™ CHAN
MOVES...disarming him, all in an effort to get to the
Malaysian face...

Prewitt takes the opportunity to strike the Henchmen with his
HYPERBARIC ARM... he gets in one good hit on each... they
back off.

He then sees that Derek needs help with Sloane, who has his
gun trained on Derek....

Matilda goes after Mugatu, yanking his RIDICULOUS HEAD DRESS
over his eyes, blinding him...

Prewitt knocks Sloane over the head with his hyperbaric
chamber, SHATTERING IT... Sloane crumbles to the ground....

Maury grabs the gun. But the henchmen grab hin...

Prewitt and Derek share an appreciative nod. But then Prewitt
looks down to his hand...

CLOSE ON HIS HAND AS IT SHRIVELS AND DECAYS in the cracked
chamber...

Maury, doing a little jig, yells to Derek, even though he is
restrained. He waves the mask in front of the Henchmen’s
faces...

MAURY (cont'd)
Hoo hoo! I’m over here Derek! Look at me!
Bad Malaysian dude!

Derek sees this and shimmies up a pine tree and throws
himself on to the Henchmen, doing a split kick, so as not to
get Maury. He knocks them both off the ledge.

They fall, bouncing off Lincoln’s nose, into oblivion. Derek
and Maury watch this, but are immediately distracted by...

Mugatu, who tussles with Matilda -- he is getting the better
of her when they both slip and ROLL OFF the top of Lincoln’s
head on to a LEDGE.

MATILDA -

Derek scampers down Lincoln’s face, like a lizard, and ‘grabs
Matilda.

Mugatu tries to push them off the cliff, but instead trips on
his own ;iatform shoes.

Derek tries to save Mugatu by grabbing the bottom of his wrap
Gress.

Mugatu’s dress unravels as he tumbles down Lincoln's cheek,
leaving him completely naked except for his platforms and
head dress as he falls to his death.

Derek stands there, holding a one hundred yard strip of
Mugatu’s outfit.

MATILDA
(gravely)
He was killed by his own poorly designed
clothing.

Derek and Matilda hug. They look around to realize they're
Stranded on Lincoln's eyebrow. Maury appears above them.

MAURY
It’s okay. there's a way up. There’s a
ledge around the comer!

Matilda immediately starts going to the end of the eyebrow,
followed by Derek.

MAURY (cont’d)
That's right. It’s just around the
corner. To the..

Suddenly Derek freezes. Matilda goes around. But Maury
realizes it too.

MAURY (cont’d)
...Left. Uhhy.

Derek immediately turns around but SLOANE, bruised and
battered, emerges around Lincoln’s nose. He moves toward
Derek, cutting him off.

SLOANE
You seem to have a little trouble going

unfortunate.

Matilda is now up with Maury.

MAURY
She’s right. Derek, forget all that crap
I talked about. Left, schmeft. Just do
it. Do it! Do it!

Sloane is now coming up on Derek. Getting ready to push him
off. Derek looks back and forth.

DEREK'S Pov
The ledge, which goes off into nothingness...

CLOSE ON DEREK

exhausted and forced to overcome the biggest obstacle in his
life... the sounds fade away...

DEREK'S POV

Magically, the dark sky behind the ledge gives way to a
montage of glowing faces...

DEREK’S MOM
My simple, simple, simple boy. I know you
can do it!

TIM

He fades off, going on and on. He is replaced by...

LARRY
Derek. You can do it son! I know if

He glances back at the ugly and battered Sloane, who is

And he walks... Strong, proud and confident as at any runway

show.. As he reaches the end of the ledge, where he must turn
left...

He can’t, and falls straight off the side of the mountain.

HANSEL IS FALLING NEXT TO HIM!

We see that he is in the middle of a bungee free fall. They

She gives Derek a long passionate kiss.

DEREK
I’ll never forget you.

Matilda walks away.

Yes you will. But that’s not your fault.
